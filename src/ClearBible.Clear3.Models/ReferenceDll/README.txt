Models | ReferenceDll | README.txt

The DLL in this folder, which is named Models.dll, is an important
part of the CLEAR software.  When I received the CLEAR software in
2020-April, we did not have source code for this DLL.

I decompiled Models.dll to create the Models project in which
this folder resides.
