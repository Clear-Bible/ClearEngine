40001001 A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham:
40001002 Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,
40001003 Judah the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram,
40001004 Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,
40001005 Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse,
40001006 and Jesse the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah’s wife,
40001007 Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,
40001008 Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram, Jehoram the father of Uzziah,
40001009 Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,
40001010 Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah,
40001011 and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.
40001012 After the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,
40001013 Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,
40001014 Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Akim, Akim the father of Eliud,
40001015 Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob,
40001016 and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
40001017 Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ.
40001018 This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
40001019 Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.
40001020 But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
40001021 She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”
40001022 All this took place to fulfil what the Lord had said through the prophet:
40001023 “The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel”—which means, “God with us.”
40001024 When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife.
40001025 But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.
40002001 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem
40002002 and asked, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.”
40002003 When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
40002004 When he had called together all the people’s chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.
40002005 “In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied, “for this is what the prophet has written:
40002006 “‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.’”
40002007 Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
40002008 He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.”
40002009 After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
40002010 When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.
40002011 On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh.
40002012 And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.
40002013 When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up,” he said, “take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.”
40002014 So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt,
40002015 where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called my son.”
40002016 When Herod realised that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.
40002017 Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:
40002018 “A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.”
40002019 After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
40002020 and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child’s life are dead.”
40002021 So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
40002022 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,
40002023 and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”
40003001 In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the Desert of Judea
40003002 and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”
40003003 This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: “A voice of one calling in the desert, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.’”
40003004 John’s clothes were made of camel’s hair, and he had a leather belt round his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
40003005 People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan.
40003006 Confessing their sins, they were baptised by him in the Jordan River.
40003007 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptising, he said to them: “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
40003008 Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
40003009 And do not think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
40003010 The axe is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
40003011 “I baptise you with water for repentance. But after me will come one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not fit to carry. He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
40003012 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing-floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
40003013 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptised by John.
40003014 But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptised by you, and do you come to me?”
40003015 Jesus replied, “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfil all righteousness.” Then John consented.
40003016 As soon as Jesus was baptised, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
40003017 And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”
40004001 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil.
40004002 After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.
40004003 The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”
40004004 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”
40004005 Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.
40004006 “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. For it is written: “‘He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’”
40004007 Jesus answered him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”
40004008 Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour.
40004009 “All this I will give you,” he said, “if you will bow down and worship me.”
40004010 Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan! For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’”
40004011 Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.
40004012 When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he returned to Galilee.
40004013 Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali—
40004014 to fulfil what was said through the prophet Isaiah:
40004015 “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, along the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—
40004016 the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.”
40004017 From that time on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”
40004018 As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
40004019 “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.”
40004020 At once they left their nets and followed him.
40004021 Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them,
40004022 and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
40004023 Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
40004024 News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralysed, and he healed them.
40004025 Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him.
40005001 Now when he saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him,
40005002 and he began to teach them, saying:
40005003 “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
40005004 Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
40005005 Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
40005006 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
40005007 Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
40005008 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
40005009 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.
40005010 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
