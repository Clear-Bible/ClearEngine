01010011 From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah
01010012 and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.
01010013 Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,
01010014 Pathrusites, Casluhites (from whom the Philistines came) and Caphtorites.
01010015 Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites,
01010016 Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,
01010017 Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,
01010018 Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans scattered
01010019 and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
01010020 These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.
01010021 Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was Japheth; Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber.
01010022 The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud and Aram.
01010023 The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether and Meshech.
01010024 Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah the father of Eber.
01010025 Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg, because in his time the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan.
01010026 Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
01010027 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
01010028 Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
01010029 Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan.
01010030 The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country.
01010031 These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.
01010032 These are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.
01011001 Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.
01011002 As men moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.
01011003 They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar.
01011004 Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”
01011005 But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building.
01011006 The LORD said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.
01011007 Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”
01011008 So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city.
01011009 That is why it was called Babel—because there the LORD confused the language of the whole world. From there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth.
01011010 This is the account of Shem. Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father of Arphaxad.
01011011 And after he became the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters.
01011012 When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Shelah.
01011013 And after he became the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
01011014 When Shelah had lived 30 years, he became the father of Eber.
01011015 And after he became the father of Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
01011016 When Eber had lived 34 years, he became the father of Peleg.
01011017 And after he became the father of Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
01011018 When Peleg had lived 30 years, he became the father of Reu.
01011019 And after he became the father of Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
01011020 When Reu had lived 32 years, he became the father of Serug.
01011021 And after he became the father of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
01011022 When Serug had lived 30 years, he became the father of Nahor.
01011023 And after he became the father of Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
01011024 When Nahor had lived 29 years, he became the father of Terah.
01011025 And after he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
01011026 After Terah had lived 70 years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran.
01011027 This is the account of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot.
01011028 While his father Terah was still alive, Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans, in the land of his birth.
01011029 Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah; she was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milcah and Iscah.
01011030 Now Sarai was barren; she had no children.
01011031 Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and together they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. But when they came to Haran, they settled there.
01011032 Terah lived 205 years, and he died in Haran.
01012001 The LORD had said to Abram, “Leave your country, your people and your father’s household and go to the land I will show you.
01012002 “I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.
01012003 I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.”
01012004 So Abram left, as the LORD had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Haran.
01012005 He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan, and they arrived there.
01012006 Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
01012007 The LORD appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built an altar there to the LORD, who had appeared to him.
01012008 From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the LORD and called on the name of the LORD.
01012009 Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev.
01012010 Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe.
01012011 As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “I know what a beautiful woman you are.
01012012 When the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me but will let you live.
01012013 Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.”
01012014 When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that she was a very beautiful woman.
01012015 And when Pharaoh’s officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace.
01012016 He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, menservants and maidservants, and camels.
01012017 But the LORD inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram’s wife Sarai.
01012018 So Pharaoh summoned Abram. “What have you done to me?” he said. “Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife?
01012019 Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!”
01012020 Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had.
01013001 So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him.
01013002 Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold.
01013003 From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier
01013004 and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the LORD.
01013005 Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.
01013006 But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together.
01013007 And quarreling arose between Abram’s herdsmen and the herdsmen of Lot. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time.
01013008 So Abram said to Lot, “Let’s not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herdsmen and mine, for we are brothers.
01013009 Is not the whole land before you? Let’s part company. If you go to the left, I’ll go to the right; if you go to the right, I’ll go to the left.”
01013010 Lot looked up and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan was well watered, like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, toward Zoar. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)
01013011 So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company:
01013012 Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.
01013013 Now the men of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the LORD.
01013014 The LORD said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, “Lift up your eyes from where you are and look north and south, east and west.
01013015 All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring forever.
01013016 I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted.
01013017 Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.”
01013018 So Abram moved his tents and went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar to the LORD.
01014001 At this time Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim
01014002 went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
01014003 All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (the Salt Sea).
01014004 For twelve years they had been subject to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
01014005 In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim
01014006 and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert.
01014007 Then they turned back and went to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazazon Tamar.
01014008 Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and drew up their battle lines in the Valley of Siddim
01014009 against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five.
01014010 Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of the men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills.
01014011 The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food; then they went away.
01014012 They also carried off Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom.
01014013 One who had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshcol and Aner, all of whom were allied with Abram.
01014014 When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.
01014015 During the night Abram divided his men to attack them and he routed them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus.
01014016 He recovered all the goods and brought back his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the other people.
01014017 After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley).
01014018 Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High,
01014019 and he blessed Abram, saying, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth.
01014020 And blessed be God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand.” Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
01014021 The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself.”
01014022 But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have raised my hand to the LORD, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth, and have taken an oath
01014023 that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the thong of a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, ‘I made Abram rich.’
01014024 I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me—to Aner, Eshcol and Mamre. Let them have their share.”
01015001 After this, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward.”
01015002 But Abram said, “O Sovereign LORD, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?”
01015003 And Abram said, “You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir.”
01015004 Then the word of the LORD came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but a son coming from your own body will be your heir.”
01015005 He took him outside and said, “Look up at the heavens and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”
01015006 Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.
01015007 He also said to him, “I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.”
01015008 But Abram said, “O Sovereign LORD, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?”
01015009 So the LORD said to him, “Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.”
01015010 Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half.
01015011 Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.
01015012 As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.
01015013 Then the LORD said to him, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.
01015014 But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions.
01015015 You, however, will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a good old age.
01015016 In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.”
01015017 When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces.
01015018 On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram and said, “To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates—
01015019 the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,
01015020 Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,
01015021 Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.”
01016001 Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar;
01016002 so she said to Abram, “The LORD has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family through her.” Abram agreed to what Sarai said.
01016003 So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.
01016004 He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.
01016005 Then Sarai said to Abram, “You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my servant in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the LORD judge between you and me.”
01016006 “Your servant is in your hands,” Abram said. “Do with her whatever you think best.” Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her.
01016007 The angel of the LORD found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur.
01016008 And he said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” “I’m running away from my mistress Sarai,” she answered.
01016009 Then the angel of the LORD told her, “Go back to your mistress and submit to her.”
01016010 The angel added, “I will so increase your descendants that they will be too numerous to count.”
01016011 The angel of the LORD also said to her: “You are now with child and you will have a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for the LORD has heard of your misery.
01016012 He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward all his brothers.”
01016013 She gave this name to the LORD who spoke to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “I have now seen the One who sees me.”
01016014 That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.
01016015 So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.
01016016 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.
01017001 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, “I am God Almighty; walk before me and be blameless.
01017002 I will confirm my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers.”
01017003 Abram fell facedown, and God said to him,
01017004 “As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations.
01017005 No longer will you be called Abram; your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations.
01017006 I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you.
01017007 I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.
01017008 The whole land of Canaan, where you are now an alien, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you; and I will be their God.”
01017009 Then God said to Abraham, “As for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to come.
01017010 This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be circumcised.
01017011 You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you.
01017012 For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner—those who are not your offspring.
01017013 Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant.
01017014 Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.”
01017015 God also said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah.
01017016 I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”
01017017 Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, “Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?”
01017018 And Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!”
01017019 Then God said, “Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.
01017020 And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.
01017021 But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year.”
01017022 When he had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.
01017023 On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God told him.
01017024 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised,
01017025 and his son Ishmael was thirteen;
01017026 Abraham and his son Ishmael were both circumcised on that same day.
01017027 And every male in Abraham’s household, including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner, was circumcised with him.
01018001 The LORD appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day.
01018002 Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.
01018003 He said, “If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, do not pass your servant by.
01018004 Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree.
01018005 Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way—now that you have come to your servant.” “Very well,” they answered, “do as you say.”
01018006 So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. “Quick,” he said, “get three seahs of fine flour and knead it and bake some bread.”
01018007 Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.
01018008 He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree.
01018009 “Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked him. “There, in the tent,” he said.
01018010 Then the LORD said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.” Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him.
01018011 Abraham and Sarah were already old and well advanced in years, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing.
01018012 So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, “After I am worn out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?”
01018013 Then the LORD said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Will I really have a child, now that I am old?’
01018014 Is anything too hard for the LORD? I will return to you at the appointed time next year and Sarah will have a son.”
01018015 Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, “I did not laugh.” But he said, “Yes, you did laugh.”
01018016 When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way.
01018017 Then the LORD said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?
01018018 Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him.
01018019 For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just, so that the LORD will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.”
01018020 Then the LORD said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous
01018021 that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.”
01018022 The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the LORD.
01018023 Then Abraham approached him and said: “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
01018024 What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it?
01018025 Far be it from you to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?”
01018026 The LORD said, “If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.”
01018027 Then Abraham spoke up again: “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes,
01018028 what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city because of five people?” “If I find forty-five there,” he said, “I will not destroy it.”
01018029 Once again he spoke to him, “What if only forty are found there?” He said, “For the sake of forty, I will not do it.”
01018030 Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?” He answered, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”
01018031 Abraham said, “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?” He said, “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.”
01018032 Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?” He answered, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.”
01018033 When the LORD had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home.
01019001 The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.
01019002 “My lords,” he said, “please turn aside to your servant’s house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.” “No,” they answered, “we will spend the night in the square.”
01019003 But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate.
01019004 Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house.
01019005 They called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.”
01019006 Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him
01019007 and said, “No, my friends. Don’t do this wicked thing.
01019008 Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don’t do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.”
01019009 “Get out of our way,” they replied. And they said, “This fellow came here as an alien, and now he wants to play the judge! We’ll treat you worse than them.” They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.
01019010 But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door.
01019011 Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.
01019012 The two men said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here,
01019013 because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.”
01019014 So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, “Hurry and get out of this place, because the LORD is about to destroy the city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.
01019015 With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished.”
01019016 When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the LORD was merciful to them.
01019017 As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, “Flee for your lives! Don’t look back, and don’t stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!”
01019018 But Lot said to them, “No, my lords, please!
01019019 Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can’t flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I’ll die.
01019020 Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it—it is very small, isn’t it? Then my life will be spared.”
01019021 He said to him, “Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of.
01019022 But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.” (That is why the town was called Zoar.)
01019023 By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land.
01019024 Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the LORD out of the heavens.
01019025 Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities—and also the vegetation in the land.
01019026 But Lot’s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
01019027 Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD.
01019028 He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.
01019029 So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.
01019030 Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave.
01019031 One day the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man around here to lie with us, as is the custom all over the earth.
01019032 Let’s get our father to drink wine and then lie with him and preserve our family line through our father.”
01019033 That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and lay with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
01019034 The next day the older daughter said to the younger, “Last night I lay with my father. Let’s get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.”
01019035 So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went and lay with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
01019036 So both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father.
01019037 The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites of today.
01019038 The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites of today.
